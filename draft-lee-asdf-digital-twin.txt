       Semantic Definition Format (SDF) modeling for Digital Twin
                   draft-lee-asdf-digital-twin-latest

Abstract

   This memo specifies SDF modeling for a digital twin, i.e. a digital
   twin system, and its interactions.  An SDF is a format to describe
   Things and their associated interactions, and to represent the
   various kinds of information that is exchanged for these
   interactions.  Therefore, the SDF format can be used to define the
   behavior of things, i.e. physical objects, and related data and
   interaction models in a digital twin that contain objects as
   components.

1.  Introduction

   A digital twin is defined as a digital representation of an object of
   interest and may require different capabilities, for example,
   synchronization and real-time support, according to the specific
   domain of application.  [Y.4600].  Digital twin help organizations
   improve important functional objectives, including real-time control,
   off-line analytics, and predictive maintenance, by modeling and
   simulating objects in the real world.  Therefore, it is important for
   a digital twin to represent as much real-world information about the
   object as possible when digitally representing the object.

   Nowadays, digital twin technologies are applied in various domains
   including manufacturing, energy, medical, farm, transportation, etc.
   And a common format is needed to represent the objects in the domains
   as digital twins.  SDF [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] can be used for modeling
   objects as digital twins.

   This document specifies the modeling and guidance on how to use SDF
   to represent objects as digital twins.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terminology specified in
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf] in particular "Class Name Keyword", "Object", and
   "Affordance".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SDF structure for digital twin

   This section describes SDF structure with the new Class Name Keyword,
   sdfNonAffordance, to represent a thing or an object as a digital
   twin.

3.1.  New Element for digital twin

   The SDF language uses six Class Name Keywords, and sdfNonAffordance
   is added as a new Class Name Keyword for digital twin.

   The information attributes for digital twin are defined in
   [ISO23247-3].  Some of them, for example characteristics and status,
   can be described using existing Class Name Keywords.  And the others,
   for example location, can be described using sdfNonAffordance.

3.2.  Architecture of Digital Twin

   The architecture of a digital twin based on the SDF model is
   illustrated in Figure 2, , following the guidelines of [ISO23247-3].

   The Physical Layer comprises affordance and non-affordance objects.
   From the real-world objects, only those deemed relevant are selected
   for representation as digital twins.  The Digital Twin Layer is
   structured into three sublayers: the Device Communication Sublayer,
   the Digital Twin Sublayer, and the Application Sublayer.  The Device
   Communication Sublayer is responsible for monitoring and collecting
   data from both affordance and non-affordance objects.  This sublayer
   provides the necessary data to synchronize the physical objects with
   their digital twin counterparts.  The Digital Twin Sublayer ensures
   synchronization between the affordance and non-affordance objects and
   their respective digital twins using the data provided by the Device
   Communication Sublayer.  The Application Sublayer presents the
   synchronized values of the digital twins to users, facilitating
   informed decision-making.

4.  Requirements for digital twin

4.1.  Overview

   A digital twin is a partial representation of sdfThing or sdfObject
   that contains attributes such as sdfProperty, sdfAction and
   sdfEvent[ISO23247-1].  By representing sdfThing as a digital twin,
   crucial events that require appropriate action can be quickly
   detected and controlled.  The requirements defined in [ISO23247-1]
   are applied to represent sdfThings and sdfObjects as digital twins.

4.2.  Data acquisition

   Data related to sdfThing and sdfObject, such as sdfProperty,
   sdfEvent, and sdfAction, should be collected from IP and non-IP
   devices.

4.3.  Data analysis

   The collected data needs to be analyzed to understand the state of
   sdfThing and sdfObject.

4.4.  Identification

   The sdfThings and sdfObjects should contain data that uniquely
   identifies them as digital twins.

4.5.  Accuracy

   The sdfThings and sdfObjects should be represented as digital twins
   with appropriate levels of detail and accuracy, depending on the
   application.

4.6.  Synchronization

   The sdfThings and sdfObjects should be synchronized with their
   digital twins in real-time as appropriate for the application.  Newly
   added or removed sdfThings and sdfObjects should be recognized and
   reflected in the digital twin.

5.  Procedures for digital twin

   A procedure for representing sdfThing, as a digital twin in a domain
   is as follows:

   *  defining a purpose for expressing the observable object, as known
      as a physical asset or an object of interest, as a digital twin in
      the domain

   *  organizing data based on the roles of the observable object in the
      domain

   *  configuring the observable object into the digital twin based on
      the data for the purposes

   *  interworking with a digital twin of each of other domains in which
      the observable object performs a different role

   *  synchronizing the observable object and the digital twin

6.  Security Considerations

   Only authorized users should have the authority to manage sdfThings
   and sdfObjects.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
