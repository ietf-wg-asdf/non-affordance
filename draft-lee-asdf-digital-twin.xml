    <t>This memo specifies SDF modeling for a digital twin,
      i.e. a digital twin system, and its interactions.
      An SDF is a format to describe Things and their associated interactions,
      and to represent the various kinds of information that is exchanged for these interactions.
      Therefore, the SDF format can be used to define the behavior of things, i.e. physical objects,
      and related data and interaction models in a digital twin that contain objects as components.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A digital twin is defined as a digital representation of an object of interest and
        may require different capabilities, for example, synchronization and real-time support,
        according to the specific domain of application. <xref target="Y.4600"/>.
        Digital twin help organizations improve important functional objectives,
        including real-time control, off-line analytics, and predictive maintenance,
        by modeling and simulating objects in the real world.
        Therefore, it is important for a digital twin to represent
        as much real-world information about the object as possible when digitally representing the object.
	     </t>

      <t>Nowadays, digital twin technologies are applied in various domains including manufacturing, energy, medical, farm, transportation, etc.
		  And a common format is needed to represent the objects in the domains as digital twins.
		  SDF <xref target="I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf"/> can be used for modeling objects as digital twins.
      </t>
      <t>This document specifies the modeling and guidance on how to use SDF to represent objects as digital twins.

          <t>The SDF language uses six Class Name Keywords, and sdfNonAffordance is added as a new Class Name Keyword for digital twin.</t>
          <t>The information attributes for digital twin are defined in <xref target="ISO23247-3"/>.
          Some of them, for example characteristics and status, can be described using existing Class Name Keywords.
          And the others, for example location, can be described using sdfNonAffordance.

              <t>The Physical Layer comprises affordance and non-affordance objects. From the real-world objects,
                only those deemed relevant are selected for representation as digital twins.
                The Digital Twin Layer is structured into three sublayers: the Device Communication Sublayer,
                the Digital Twin Sublayer, and the Application Sublayer.
                The Device Communication Sublayer is responsible for monitoring and collecting data
                from both affordance and non-affordance objects.
                This sublayer provides the necessary data to synchronize the physical objects with their digital twin counterparts.
                The Digital Twin Sublayer ensures synchronization between the affordance and non-affordance objects
                and their respective digital twins using the data provided by the Device Communication Sublayer.
                The Application Sublayer presents the synchronized values of the digital twins to users,
                facilitating informed decision-making.</t>

                models that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are
                available for interaction over a network. An SDF specification
                describes definitions of SDF Objects/SDF Things and their associated
                interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data
                types for the information exchanged in those interactions. Tools
                convert this format to database formats and other serializations as
                needed.

               of basic information elements that can be used for describing a large
               share of the existing data models from different ecosystems.  While
               these data models are typically very simple, such as basic sensors
               definitions, more complex models, and in particular bigger systems,
               benefit from ability to describe additional information on how
               different definitions relate to each other.  This document specifies
               an extension to SDF for describing complex relationships in class
               level descriptions.  This specification does not consider instance-
               specific information.
